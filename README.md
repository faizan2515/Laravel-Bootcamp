# Laravel Bootcamp

Introduction to Laravel were I built a small application (Chirps) with basic CRUD operations demonstrated on [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/) with React as frontend. In this series I learnt:

-   How to setup Laravel ?
-   Most common artisan commands.
-   Installing Laravel breeze which offers authentication features.
-   Along side Laravel breeze installed React as view layer.
-   Implemented basic CRUD operations with auth middleware.
